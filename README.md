# DataTools
First point of reference for tools developed for specific datasets (downloading and access).

## 'Quick Start'
Look at https://www.github.com/GlacioHack/DataTools/projects/1/ to see the current ideas, those which have been moved forward to planning, and those which are currently being developed.

## Strategy

Development and/or collation of scripts and drivers for access to specific types of data, e.g. Landsat images, regional climate model outputs, etc.

Initial planning on this is centred around the DataTools Google Doc (available to all GlacioHack recipients).

There is a Project board associated with this empty repository for our 'top-level' to-do list.

This repository will should remain empty apart from this README, which can be updated by anyone with useful links and directions to tools in development, to basically act as a home page for all the GlacioHack data tools.

Each individual data tool should be developed in its own repository within the GlacioHack organisation. Just as with GeoUtils, development should only take place within branches, not on main. Speak to Andrew (or Bob) about how to set up a repository for a new tool if you're unsure.
