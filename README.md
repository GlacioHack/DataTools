# DataTools
First point of reference for tools developed for specific datasets (downloading and access).

## Strategy

We are thinking about developing (or at least collating) scripts for access to specific types of data, e.g. Landsat images, regional climate model outputs, etc.

Initial planning on this is centred around the DataTools Google Doc (available to all GlacioHack recipients).

There is a Project board associated with this empty repository in which we will maintain our 'top-level' To-Do list.

This repository will probably stay near-empty. We can consider gradually updating this README page with useful links and directions to tools in development, to basically act as a home page for all the GlacioHack data tools.

Each individual data tool should be developed in its own repository within the GlacioHack organisation. Just as with GeoUtils, development should only take place within branches, not on main. Speak to Andrew (or Bob) about how to set up a repository for a new tool if you're unsure.
